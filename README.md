# directus-libsql

Experimental/PoC support for `libsql` in `Directus`.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is an **experimental** project and consists in workarounds and small patches to make it work without modifying the core of Directus.
> In order to make Directus work nicely with libsql, some changes need to land in both Directus and libsql first.
